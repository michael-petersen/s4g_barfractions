This directory contains text files with bar fractions as a function of stellar mass,
*g - r* color, or gas mass ratio from various published studies (mostly extracted
from the original figures using Dexter).

All data are from local (*z* < 0.1) SDSS-based studies, except for the high-redshift
*HST*-based study of Sheth et al. (2008).

See individual files for sources; see paper for full references.
