# Datasets for bar-frequencies paper using S4G data

## Main combined-data table

`s4gbars_table.dat` = data for 1322 individual galaxies in Parent Disk Sample.


## Tables of bar presence/absence

These tables list bar presence/absence (coded as 1 or 0) for galaxies in Sample 1
with log stellar mass between 8.5 and 11 along with log stellar mass, weights, and
(for the 2nd and 3rd table) either g-r color or log of gas mass ratio.

(These tables can be regenerated by code in the Python `XXX` notebook.)

   * `barpresence_vs_logmstar_for_R_w25_m8.5-11.txt` (563 galaxies)
   
   * `barpresence_vs_logmstar-gmr_for_R_w25.txt` (319 galaxies)
   
   * `barpresence_vs_logmstar-logfgas_for_R_w25.txt` (556 galaxies)


For use with R notebook `s4gbars_R_logistic-regression.ipynb` for weighted logistic regression
analysis.


## 10%/90% LOESS boundaries for bar sizes (GZ2 and S4G); GZ2 bar sizes

These are two-column files with log of stellar mass in the first column and 10% or
90% LOESS-smoothed estimates for bar size (log of observed semi-major axis in kpc).

   * `hoyle+11_gz2_barsizes_10percentile.txt`

   * `hoyle+11_gz2_barsizes_90percentile.txt`
   
   * `s4g_barsizes_10percentile.txt`
   
   * `s4g_barsizes_90percentile.txt`

For use with Python notebook `s4gbars_barsizes.ipynb` for making Figure 8 of the paper.
The latter figure also uses observed bar sizes in Galaxy Zoo 2 galaxies from Hoyle et al.
(2011):

   * `GalaxyZoo2_barlengths_alldata.txt`
