# Datasets for bar-frequencies paper using S4G data

## Tables for Python-based analyses and figures

### Main combined-data table

See the table header (and the paper) for sources.

   * `s4gbars_table.dat` = data for 1322 individual galaxies in Parent Disk Sample.


### Galaxy Zoo 2 bar sizes and galaxy stellar masses

The following table contains observed bar sizes in kpc and estimated
stellar masses for Galaxy Zoo 2 bars, based on the data in Hoyle et al.
(2011). It is used in the Python notebook `s4gbars_barsizes.ipynb` to
help make Figure 8 of the paper.


(The table can be regenerated by the `generate_GZ2-bar-sizes_table.py` script, using tables
contained -- or referenced -- in the external/ subdirectory.)

   * `GalaxyZoo2_barlengths_alldata.txt`


### 10%/90% quantile LOESS boundaries for bar sizes (GZ2 and S4G)

These are two-column files with log of stellar mass in the first column and 10% or
90% LOESS-smoothed estimates for bar size (log of observed semi-major axis in kpc).
They are used in the Python notebook `s4gbars_barsizes.ipynb` to help make Figure 8 of the paper,
and can be regenerated using the R notebook `s4gbars_R_quantile-loess.ipynb`.

   * `hoyle+11_gz2_barsizes_10percentile.txt`

   * `hoyle+11_gz2_barsizes_90percentile.txt`
   
   * `s4g_barsizes_10percentile.txt`
   
   * `s4g_barsizes_90percentile.txt`


### Summaries of bar-observation simulations

These are generated by the `make_simulated_surveys.py` script; they are used in the
Python notebook `s4gbars_simulated-surveys.ipynb`.

   * `sim_logfgas_d30_2xfwhm_SDSS_200_dp-sizes.txt`
   
   * `sim_logfgas_d30m95_sp_2xfwhm_SDSS_200_HI-limited.txt`
   
   * `sim_logMstar_d30_sp_2xfwhm_SDSS_200_dp-sizes.txt`

## Tables for R-based analyses

### Tables of bar presence/absence

These tables list bar presence/absence (coded as 1 or 0) for galaxies in Sample 1
with log stellar mass between 8.5 and 11, along with log stellar mass, weights, and
(for the 2nd and 3rd table) either *g*-*r* color or log of gas mass ratio.

(These tables can be regenerated by code in the Python `s4gbars_main.ipynb` notebook.)

   * `barpresence_vs_logmstar_for_R_w25_m8.5-11.txt` (563 galaxies)
   
   * `barpresence_vs_logmstar-gmr_for_R_w25.txt` (319 galaxies)
   
   * `barpresence_vs_logmstar-logfgas_for_R_w25.txt` (556 galaxies)


For use with R notebook `s4gbars_R_logistic-regression.ipynb` for weighted logistic regression
analysis.

### Tables for use in generating quantile LOESS boundaries

These are tables of bar size versus log of stellar mass (sorted into ascending order in
the latter) for use with the R notebook
`s4gbars_R_quantile-loess.ipynb`.

   * `obs-barsize-vs-logmstar_Hoyle+2011_for-R_sorted.txt`

   * `obs-barsize-vs-logmstar_sample1_for-R_sorted.txt`
